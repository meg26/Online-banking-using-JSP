        <h4>BUILDING BLOCKS<br>

            One of the earliest banks in South India, "XYZ Bank" came into being during the Swadeshi movement. <br>
            The establishment of the bank was the fulfillment of the dreams of a group of enterprising men who
            joined<br>
            together at Thrissur, a major town (now known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala), in the erstwhile State of
            Cochin<br>
            to provide for the people a safe, efficient and service oriented repository of savings of the community on
            one hand <br>
            and to free the business community from the clutches of greedy money lenders on the other by providing need
            based credit at reasonable rates of interest.
            <br>
            Translating the vision of the founding fathers as its corporate mission, the bank has during its long
            sojourn been able to project itself as a vibrant, fast growing, service oriented and trend setting financial
            intermediary.
